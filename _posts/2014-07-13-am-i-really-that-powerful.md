People often speak of miracles by saying that they experience the power of God as if the power of God was beyond anything we can readily imagine or experience. But the truth is, as we develop the receptivity to OWNING God&#8217;s power as our OWN and start to realize that it is within each and every one of us, we begin to develop what has been called the mental equivalent of that which we want to create. We get the KNOWING that it is already ours. &#8220;The Secret&#8221; reminded us and the Law of Attraction teaches us, but do we really know our power?

I can remember the first time, way back when, that I did a spiritual mind treatment or affirmative prayer. I remember feeling? Wow? What I am speaking is really going to happen. In fact, it is happening as I speak. Do you remember the first time that happened to you? We get that there is a Power that we can use. We get to the knowing and owning that it is already ours. That&#8217;s when we come to see the miraculous as the ordinary in our experience. Do you really know how powerful you are? Do you know that the same power that is &#8220;out there&#8221; is in each and every one of us?

I remember once a woman coming to see me, whom I had not met before. She had only been to our church once, so she didn&#8217;t really know any of this teaching. She started telling me about a serious problem she was having with cancer. And as she was speaking, I got real clear that her problem had nothing to do with cancer. She began to share more and more, and began to tell me about the fact that she had been and was still in a very abusive relationship. She began to say to me, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the issue. I&#8217;m terrified of stepping out on my own. Where would I ever get insurance?

Who would take care of me? (Not that he was taking care of her!) I just listened and didn&#8217;t say a word to this woman. She sat there and looked at me and said, &#8220;I think I brought this into my life.&#8221; I would never have said to her, &#8220;You brought cancer into your life.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe in that. You don&#8217;t want to look at people and say, &#8220;You have a cold? You must be doing xyz.&#8221; She said to me, &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to realize that my allowing these experiences is actually causing and creating my experiences.&#8221;

She was sitting in a chair and she suddenly jumped up out of the chair and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m powerful, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, you are.&#8221; Then she said, &#8220;If I can do that, I can change my life.&#8221; She looked at me and started to cry, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been through years and years of therapy and I&#8217;ve never felt free. I&#8217;m free.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t do a thing. She heard herself and in my presence, while I held a conscious space, she began to see her own power.

So, for all of us who are creating muck in our lives, see how powerful we are? Look what we can do. When we speak our word, and know what it is very clearly that we want, we can create it.
