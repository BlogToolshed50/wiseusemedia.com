As we are aware of the menace of HIV is going unabated though all out effort is made to attack it by various nations. The concern is more when the child born with HIV could not be diagnosed before 18 months when the blood test is done to know the presence of this killer disease.

Recently the researchers in India has come out with the technique of testing the child after six weeks of delivery. The highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test administered is found to give the accurate result for the presence or otherwise of HIV in the new born.

When the earlier techniques were able to identify the presence after 18 months of delivery, the present one is helpful to treat the child at the initial stage. The doctors could start the lifesaving Anti-Retroviral Treatment, the only effective way to treat HIV as early as possible after the test to save the child. In fact, the counseling and the psychological approach is also bound to reduce the occurrence of this dreadful disease in the society.
