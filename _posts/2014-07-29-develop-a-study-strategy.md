When preparing to take the exam, you need a study strategy to ensure your success

1) Consider working alone and with a study group.

There are benefits to doing both types of study. First off, working alone will enable you to work through problems without distraction. You can go at your own pace and focus on areas that might be troublesome to you and speed up certain sections that you know like the back of your hand.

2) With that in mind, working in groups also offers benefits.

There may be others in your group who are experts in areas that you’re weak in. Get the best of both worlds by studying alone and with a study group.

3) Practice as many sample questions and problems as you can.

The sample questions and problems in study guides will help you identify where your weaknesses are. On top of that, the sample questions and problems will help you get comfortable with the way questions and problems are posed on the test. Since study guides usually contain old exam questions, you can begin to identify a test-taking strategy that works for you before you actually get to the exam.

4) Practice timing yourself on the questions by using the study guides.

This will help to make sure that you can work through all the questions within the time frame specified. Since answering more questions generally means a higher chance of success, you’ll want to answer as many questions as possible. As you practice timing yourself with practice exams, you will also want to practice your test-taking strategies to see how your strategy works for you. You’ll be able to improve on speed as well as practice honing in on the key idea that the question asks.

5) Look for your weak areas in the practice tests.

As you review your test questions, look for the areas where you don’t answer as many questions correctly. This tells you were you might be weak technically and which sections in the subject area you need to study. You will also want to look for areas where you don’t seem to understand what the questions are asking. This might signify a technical skill weakness, but it might also signify an area where you need to study how the section is actually tested.

6) Focus your study time on your weaker areas as you approach test day.

When using the study guide, one study strategy that many have found particularly helpful is to focus their study efforts on the areas that have posed the most problems. Instead of focusing on every area of the test, test takers were able to delve deeper into problem areas simply because they were able to commit more attention to those areas.

Preparation is your critical foundation for success in the exam. By setting yourself up with a regular study strategy, you will be paving the way for success on exam day!
