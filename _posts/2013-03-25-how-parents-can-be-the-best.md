“Raising up kids is no kidding” they say. Parenting is one of the biggest challenges which one faces. Are you having trouble parenting? Searching for good parenting tips or parenting advice books or articles? Don’t feel embarrassed or prejudiced in learning about better parenting. Parenting is an art similar to the job of an earthen pot maker, where your child is like wet soil, it is you who give them shape and mould them into individuals they are today. The more skillfully you do your job, better is the outcome. To get more idea read on.

First and the foremost parenting tip that you would ever get is “always practice what you preach” .you are the first ideal for your children, they watch you since birth and simply follow your ways. They would stop following and respecting you the moment they realize your preaching is just verbose and you don’t apply it practically yourself. For being your kid’s best teacher, first fasten up your belts. You need to apply lots of commonsense and practical attitude in dealing with their affairs. Praise your child more often for the good work they do, howsoever small it may be. In Today’s competitive world your child’s upbringing plays a major deciding factor for his/her survival and excelling in these testing times.

Remember how beautifully your parents raised you up. parenting is something that comes instinctively that’s true, but with changing times and changing lifestyle it has become more challenging. Don’t you find yourself helpless at times with some problem related to your child? At times you have to be strict with them and give them tough punishments for their betterment, but things don’t turn out the way you expected. May be your ways and means to deal with them are not proper. Parent’s frustration makes an upward swing when children do not agree with you or understand your real motives; they start their own line of thinking and understanding things, all this resulting in clashes and affecting the atmosphere at home. In such hot moments it is more of parents’ responsibility to sit back and think coolly where things are going wrong. After all the person you are dealing is your own child. Wouldn’t you like to deal with him or her in the best possible manner?
