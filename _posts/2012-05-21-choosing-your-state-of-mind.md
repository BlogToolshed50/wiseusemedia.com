Speaking of controlling the situation, it is vital that you know which ones can be subjected to your control and which one&#8217;s are beyond you. Rather than beat yourself up by trying to control external factors, why not look within yourself and see if you have yourself under your control first? Bearing in mind that the only thing you can really control is yourself, why waste precious time and effort manipulating anything else?

If others&#8217; attitudes or behaviors is stressing you out, there is nothing you can do to change them if they themselves refuse to budge. However, you can choose not to be affected by them if you want to. Living in a free world entitles each one of us to do as he pleases. The action-reaction theory does not necessarily apply to humans because we have individual wills each one can exercise freely. So rather than drive yourself crazy imposing your will on others(even if it is for their own good); sit back, relax and get a hold of yourself.

Choosing your state of mind regardless of circumstances and other people empowers you to stay in control. Even if you are surrounded by madness, you can easily stay sane. Given that you use your will by exercising your inherent right to acquire a specific mindset, shedding unnecessary stress caused by external factors would be a piece of cake.
