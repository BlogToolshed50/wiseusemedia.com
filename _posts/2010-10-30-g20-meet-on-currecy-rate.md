The latest G20 meeting held at South Korea has become so important as the currency war worldwide is not going in the right direction. When every country, mostly those who depend upon export economy, likes to devalue their currency, this has made the goods costly for the developing countries importing such goods. I feel happy that IMF has intervened here to certain extent to make the countries to agree for a &#8220;Market Determined&#8221; forex rate.

If the countries like China and Japan intervenes in the Forex market to weaken their currencies, there is bound to be some imbalance in the trade balance. It is also a consolation for the participating countries that the G20 meet could impress upon the USA to avoid flooding the developing markets with more liquidity.

The other aspect that is welcome is the attempt made by hem to cap the current account balance to avoid the derailment in the forex market. The decision to allow the emerging economies like India and Brazil to enhance their voting power at G20 is a welcome sign to involve everyone to participate in the decision making. Balanced forex rate alone can sustain the economic recovery at this present stage.
