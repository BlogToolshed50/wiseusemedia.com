The process of starting a business or choosing a career is very enjoyable and stressful at the same time. It's a good type of stress, but stress nonetheless. One way to
keep your sanity in the midst of growth is to do what you know!

Let's say that your vision is to teach business, personal development and internet classes. Narrow the list down to 4 or 5 classes that can teach in your sleep! Well, don't take
me literally...please!! Teach classes on subjects you've taught before or topics with which you're very familiar.

Or maybe your vision is to operate a full-service, 5-employee virtual assistant business -- the premier placeclients stop for all their services. Here comes potential
client "X" wanting you to re-design a database for use on their web site. You take on the job knowing that you don't have any knowledge about databases or web sites. My question
for you is why?

If you are just starting a business or growing your career, here are some questions to ask yourself...

~~What are you passionate about? What is that "something" that you do as a volunteer or would do without being paid?
~~What do you do in your business now, that is very familiar. What would taking that skill to the next level look like?
~~What skills do you have now, that others can benefit fromFree Articles, and that will generate an income for you?
~~What are you doing to build a strong business or career foundation?

Build your confidence slowly and surely as you build a strong foundation. Start with what you know! I bet you know plenty
