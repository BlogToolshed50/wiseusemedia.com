Infants need high levels of DHA, or docosahexaenoic acid, for brain development and function. But Sheila Innis, of the University of British Columbia, believes that they may not be able to produce sufficient DHA on their own, and may need a dietary supplement to avoid deficits in brain function. She is testing her belief by feeding piglets diets with and without DHA. DHA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is transferred to the fetus during gestation and is found in breast milk. However, it is not present in fruits and vegetables, infant formulas, or nutritional products used for adults and children with gastro-intestinal diseases.
