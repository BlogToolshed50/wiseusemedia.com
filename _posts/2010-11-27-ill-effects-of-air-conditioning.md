With the increase in the global warming, our dependence on the air conditioning at home and office has increased simultaneously. It is a matter of great concern that every one of us needs the comfort against the scorching heat under the air conditioning without minding the ill effects of the same. As a I read an article on this subject, it was shocking that too much dependence on the air conditioning leads to lots of health related issues.

In various studies, it is confirmed that, people who are in the air condition atmosphere for a long period, are prone to breathing difficulties, headache, neurological problems, membrane irritation and various other skin diseases. You will be surprised to know that, the contaminated air emanated from the air conditioning system adds to the health problem very much. The microbiological exposures due to the continuous exposure to the air conditioning affects the health of the person.

Another study has indicated that, the Hypersensitivity pneumonia like illness are also caused by the air conditioned environment. When our forefathers enjoyed a healthy life under the natural aeration, we are suffering due to our in ability to get along with the nature. In fact, it is high time that we wake up to the necessity of living with greater orientation to the nature rather than inviting the unwarranted health problems under the guise of luxury.
