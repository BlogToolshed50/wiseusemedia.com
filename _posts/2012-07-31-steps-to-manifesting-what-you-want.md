Manifesting is the process by which your thought becomes things in your reality. Whether it is something you really, really want or something you really, really fear, manifesting, through the law of attraction will work. Events will unfold so that it will lead the way to the materialization of the object of your attention.

Be mindful of the things in your mind for your thoughts can work for you or against you. Deliberately create your present and your future by consciously directing your thoughts towards your desires. Here are some simple steps to manifesting what you want.

1. Know what you truly want. If you know what you truly want, your heart, mind and soul are one with your desire. You can give your undivided attention to this particular goal.

2. Keep the end in mind. Have a very clear vision of the end result of your desire. Make it as vivid as if it is really there with you. See it, hear it, feel it, smell it or taste it. It is not your job how it will be manifested; your job is to envision what will be manifested.

3. Cooperate. Make your actions congruent with your desires. Recognize opportunities and grab them.

4. Pretend you have it and give thanks. Play the game of pretend. Give thanks like you already have what you want and it will indeed come to you.

Remember to let go of all control once you have done your job. Know that one way or another, sooner or later, you will receive what you have asked. Frustrations and negative attitudes will just delay the manifestations of your desire, so relax and trust that it is coming.

Consciously choose the path you wish to take. Deliberately create your experiences. Once in a while, life may throw something bitter at you, but stop for a moment before you react. Ask yourself, &#8220;Is this really as bitter as it looks, or does it hide something better?&#8221;
