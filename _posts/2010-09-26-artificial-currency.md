As individual needs the financial assistance, every nation needs monetary assistance from international agencies. Most of the countries avail the financial assistance from the World Bank or International Monetary Fund. The Special Drawing Right is one among the means of getting the fund assistance from IMF.

In fact SDR is nothing but an artificial currency unit that is based on the currencies of various nations. It is a supplemental reserve and the individual nation has got its own limit to draw under this channel.

SDR can be used to settle the trade balance between the countries and also to repay the loan taken from the IMF. The Country which owes money to the other country on account of trade, the payment can be done through the SDRs or in the currency of its own if it is not having sufficient balance under the SDR to meet the requirement. SDR can also be used to repay the loan taken by various countries from IMF.
