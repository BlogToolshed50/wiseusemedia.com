I have always dream of joining an aerobics class. I have seen people performing aerobics and it is truly amazing. I was happy to find out that aerobics classes were administered in my university. I just decided to take a class this Spring. There were dance aerobics, step aerobics, power step aerobics, aqua aerobics and regular aerobics. Since the other classes were all filled, I decided to take step classes. Now, its my fifth week of class and week by week, its getting real fun! The best part is the music that is being played. When you donâ€™t loose your rhythm and co-ordinate and synchronize your steps with the music, then it can be real fun!

But a caveat to keep in mind is that its an intense workout and people who have not done any exercise in the near past (like me) should not get too much into it at the first go. They should gradually increase their workout time till they get comfortable.
