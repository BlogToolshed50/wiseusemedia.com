Do you know that, an extent of around 3.90 billion hectares of the world is covered by the thick forest?. The two continents that are devoid of the precious forest cover are Antartica and Greenland. It is a well-known fact that the forest cover in the word is shrinking day by day due to the greed of the man-kind in destroying the natural wealth.

Though we know the advantages of the forest cover in the matter of getting timely rain and the much needed Oxygen, we have not given up our attack on the forest cover to denude the earth. You can divide the forest under six different categories like, Alpine, Sub Alpine, Moist Tropical, Dry Tropical, Montane temperate forests, and Montane Sub tropical forests.

Forest can help the man-kind in various other ways to contain the carbon emission which has assumed a disastrous proposition. Even if we are unable to add additional areas under the forest, it is better that we desist from destroying them indiscriminately keeping in mind about the ill effects of deforestation. Every individual is interested in living in harmony with the nature should attempt to improve the forest wealth.
