How to Make your pc as your money making machine?.You can use it as more meaningful and profitable than just entertainment and surfing.Of course you can use your own skills for good use.Apart from tedious coding and painful modeling there are some areas where anybody can show their talent.

First of all you should prepare a proper business plan with a bit of working capital.Your business plan is what will give you the impetus to put your idea into action.It should describe the aim your venture.Once you introspect and see the Big picture of what you plan to get into don&#8217;t get overwhelmed.The biggest hurdle really is taking the leap mentally-once you believe its a viable proposition and you can make it work the rest is pretty simple.So go for it!.

Writing
  
Writing is a skill that demands low on requirements but heavy on workloads and deadline.But being a writer is not an easy job. When you get into writing business,you must first identify your workloads and nature of the contents your clients looking for.The requirements will vary depending upon the format.One of your clients may need a printable format of your content so you should be ready with quark or adobe page maker.you may also need to install a translator or thesaurus software to help you out in your work.

The key Equipment

The three most important pieces of hardware in your setup should be your monitor,keyboard and internet connection.Computing speed is not an issue here because most computers today can perform well when it comes to word-processing.First plan your specifications for your computer and peripherals needed within your budget.

The monitor
  
Mostly your work will revolve around text on screen,choose a monitor with care.Since you are dealing with text you could be satisfied with a 15 -inch monitor.On the other hand if you also need to layout pages a larger screen will be a better choice.But for larger screen the processing speed must be taken into account.
  
Either ways,the important things is that it should be comfortable.Make sure that your monitor is capable of running at a refresh rate of at least 75 Hz at the resolution you are comfortable with.Pay great attention to this!you will suffer watery eyes and headaches after a long day spent writing if you choose poorly and if the refresh rate and resolution are uncomfortable, don&#8217;t listen to the salesperson&#8217;s spiel follow your instincts. Don&#8217;t get taken in by fancy sounding names and anti glare.These technologies are great but once again it serves no purpose if you are not genuine comfortable with the screen quality.

The keyboard
  
Selecting a keyboard for successful writing is quite difficult as the market now is flooded with many models.Every keyboard is constructed differently.What you feel good may be clunky to the other.you should be comfortable using the keyboard &#8211; try out the ones with a palm rest or those based on the &#8216;natural&#8217; layout and see if they feel right to you.And do not scrounge on the cost.

The internet
  
You will need to Setup a reliable internet connection.Not fast but reliable since the bulk of your work will involve text documents.if you are already satisfied with your service provider that&#8217;s enough.
  
Any connection that offers dial-up (56 kpbs) speed and has a proven track record for reliability should suit you fine.For larger transfer of files you should opt for high speed internet once again make sure that your don&#8217;t trade off on reliability.

Other peripherals
  
There are other peripherals that you might need depending upon your budget and requirements.If you find that your clients do not need a hard copy of your work.You need not invest in a printer-you can get the one off printout from any printing shop.Also you might consider investing in a USB thumb drive.These are handy when it comes for porting documents between computers.

Also spend some time to create the right work environment. Make sure you have a comfortable chair and that it makes you sit with current posture.An incorrect posture over hours of continuous typing can be disastrous for your neck and back in the long run.Also make sure that your typing position is proper your keyboard should be at the same level as your elbow when sitting upright.Finally ensure that your room is uniformly lit.
