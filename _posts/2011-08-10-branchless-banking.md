Branchless banking is the latest trend in the banking sector. With the advent of technology in the banking transactions the need for the bank branch has become redundant. Anywhere banking through the Automatic Teller Machines, internet banking and mobile banking has paved the way for the customers to reach their account without visiting the branch premises. It has reduced the cost and energy from the point of view of the customers and the reduced overhead for the banks to improve their bottom line.
