The power is captured through the solar plates kept in the open sun and they convert the sun rays in to usable energy. In the hospitality industry, many hotels are completely dependent on the solar water heaters to provide hot water for bathing. Solar water heaters are becoming popular and are being used in many houses. It saves lots of electricity and uses the natural sunlight to produce the needed energy. We should also use such energy source at our houses to reduce the electricity consumption.
