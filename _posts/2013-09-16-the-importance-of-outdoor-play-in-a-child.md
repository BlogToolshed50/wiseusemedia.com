Going outside to play is important to the healthy growth and development of children of all ages. The outdoors are a great place for children to run and play, getting the physical activity they need to stay healthy. The outdoors are also the best place for children to learn about their environment through their own discovery.

The outdoors offer all sorts of natural objects that encourage play and learning. From pine cones to dirt, there are opportunities everywhere for play. A selection of traditional toys designed for outside play will simulate even more creativity and discovery in your child.

Sandboxes are one of the most entertaining and educational traditional toys available for outside play. Sifting, pouring, and shoveling sand helps to develop the small muscles in the fingers and wrists associated with fine motor development. Traditional toys for sand play, like pails and dump trucks, encourage children to push or carry and to dump. Both of these activities aid in large muscle development.

Other great traditional toys that stimulate learning and discovery outdoors are balls. Balls of various sizes and styles can be kicked, tossed, and caught. Balls can also be used in a variety of organized games that help develop social skills, like healthy competitiveness, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Playhouses and play tents are traditional toys that not only offer a bit of shade from the sun, but provide hours of creative play opportunities for children.

Outdoor play sets are also a fun way for children to be active outdoors. Traditional toys, like swings and slides, are commonly found on outdoor play sets, as well as more modern outdoor play equipment, like rock walls. Outdoor play sets are available in many different styles and sizes and can be easily installed right in your backyard. Many play sets have options to add on other traditional toys, like play houses, forts, and sandboxes, for even more outdoor fun all in one convenient place.

Bicycles and ride on toys are traditional toys that have been cruising residential sidewalks and driveways for nearly a century. Ride on toys and pedal toys are one of the best ways children can develop strong leg muscles, and they provide children with so much enjoyment! Traditional toys, like kites or wind socks, are also a lot of fun to play with outside. Kites are a great tool to teach children the effects of the wind as well.

There are also a number of games available for outdoor play. Traditional toys like ring toss sets, badminton, and hopscotch, all aid in healthy development. A few other traditional toys that are sure to entertain and educate your child include bubbles, sidewalk chalk, and water toys.

It is recommended that children get an average of 90 minutes of physical activity each day for healthy development. Playing outside is one of the most enjoyable ways to stay active, especially with a good selection of traditional toys. The outdoors are also a good way to enjoy fresh air and sunshine that promotes healthy growth.
