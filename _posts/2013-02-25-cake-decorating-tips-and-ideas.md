• Frost the sides of the cake with lots of icing and steady hands. Start icing with thin layers before moving to the thicker ones.
  
• Apply dollops of icing in the corners and in the middle of the cake.

• Style the frosting once it is applied by using a fork across the top of the cake to create a lattice effect. You can also use a knife to create swirls along the top edges of the cake.
