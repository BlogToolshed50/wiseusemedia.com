When we are interested in preserving our environment and produce healthy agricultural products, it is a must that we use the bio pesticides. The bio pesticides are of biological origin from the viruses, bacteria, plant and animals. They are natural and not synthetic. Global bio pesticide consumption is estimated at 24 million kg per Annam.

Bio pesticides are environmental friendly and they are easily bio degradable. You can find very minimum and negligible residue of bio pesticides when compared to the chemical and synthetic pesticides. Bio pesticides are used in the integrated pesticide management along with the chemical pesticides to minimize the ill effects of using the synthetic pesticides alone. Bio pesticides are cost effective and they are comparatively cheaper.
