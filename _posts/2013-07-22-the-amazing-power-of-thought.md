The human mind and our own individual thoughts, as well as the actions resulting from those thoughts, are one of the most powerful influences on everything that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that ever will exist. By just the power of our mind, we can create! While human thought does hold the power to bring things into existence and we can bring about change through directed thinking, our minds alone can not create the peaceful existence we each long for.

Within our universe, there are several common laws that govern our actions, our thoughts, and our general sense of being. Universalism and the welfare of all humanity must be the center of our thoughts if we desire change, success, or other positive results in our life and those around us. Once we leave our individualistic ideas behind and focus on the big picture, we can see the affects our thoughts.

Each individual person on the face of the planet plays a role in the operation of the universe. When everyone, everywhere follows the guiding principles of the universe, our minds will be in tune and our thoughts will create prosperity and happiness. What we make of ourselves, who we are, is influenced greatly by the people around us, their thoughts and their actions.

Our thoughts alone do indeed hold life-altering power, but without the guidance of a Higher Being we are useless. Every day we witness the wonders of the universe, all set in place by the Creator. Like the natural and magnificent rise and setting of the sun and the miracle of the fowl of the air, who never go hungry yet are incapable of producing food, the peace and happiness of nature can engulf our lives as well when we follow our spiritual sides.

A spirit led life allows you to live freely, letting go of your selfish desires that only create strife and discontent. When the guiding principle of the universe, treating others the way you would like to be treated, steers your thoughts, you have the true power to achieve your dreams. With a selfless nature you can live harmoniously with nature and with those around you, enjoying true happiness and prospering effortlessly, just like the plants that bloom magnificently without ever trying.

Centering your thoughts on your own needs and your personal desires can only lead to sorrow and discontent. If, instead, you direct your thoughts to a universal level and consider the needs of all humanity, you will find the satisfaction of worthwhile living
