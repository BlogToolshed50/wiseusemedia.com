“Inspiration” is defined as a sudden intuition or light that gives a solution for a problem. Having an inspiration is always beneficial because it makes you look forward for the betterment of your career and for your life. The light of inspiration is always triggered by a spark inside each individual. It must be ignited to continuously motivate a person to take the necessary path, which is aligned to the person’s deepest interest and passion in life. Hence, each individual must protect the spark of inspiration from the distractions that stands before them.

Here are some reminders to keep the spark in you, alive.

1. Always look for new interests, ideas, hobby, routine or activity. Do not dismiss anything until you have fully explored the possibilities it entails.

2. Do no forget to pursue other things aside from your work. Sometimes people get too exhausted from work that they don’t have time to do other things that equally matter.

3.Cliche as it may sound but remember to live life to the fullest. Stay away from doing routines by making each day more exciting than the last. Have a break whenever you could, and continuously live up your life, but not in a mediocre type.

4.Do not be afraid of making changes and doing something that takes an extra effort. Becoming complacent with work or life will get you nowhere while doing random things adds excitement and bursts pleasant surprises. Be impulsive sometimes to know what are the things that you’re capable of, perhaps it will make you a better person eventually.

5.Be with people who exudes positive vibe because those are the individuals who you can share inspiring ideas, exciting dreams and take new directions. Exercise can also produce endorphins that naturally makes you happy, if you’re stress this will makes you feel better.

6.Nurture the courage to live your dreams and aspiration. Each person might have a dream as simple or big as it is, but not everyone pursue it. In the words of Bill Shankly, “Aim for the sky and you’ll reach the ceiling. Aim for the ceiling and you’ll stay on the floor.”

7.Always follow what you want to do rather than what your supposed to do because family, friends or society says so. Doing the right thing is always just but consider if it pleases your inner passion or it merely satisfies the people around you.

To fully live life, a person must keep his inspiration spark alive. This make him strive for more each day to become better and stronger. He must also leave his comfort zone once in a while to try new things and explore vast possibilities
