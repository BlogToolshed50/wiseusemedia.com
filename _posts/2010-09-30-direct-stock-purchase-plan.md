You must have heard about the Direct Stock Purchase Plan which permits the company to sell the shares directly to investors. This helps the buyer to avoid the commission to be paid to the share broker. As I could understand this way if the shares are offered, one can buy the same in small lot and also the surplus on hand.

As an individual who does not own the share of the company, you can opt for the same and enjoy the return. The company may charge a nominal fee from you while purchasing the shares to set up a stock purchase account. It is found to be an easy and simple way to get the share of a company without the intervention of the market players.

While every one of us is interested in investing in liquid assets like stocks, it is better that we avail the route of Direct Stock Purchase from the company as and when the offer is made to reduce the cost of investment. It is better that we see the fundamentals of the company and buy the shares that can give the maximum return.
