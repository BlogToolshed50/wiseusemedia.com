The term Obesity in Childhood is show the excessive weight of body in comparison of normal child weight. This may be a reason of much dangerous disease in body in childhood. There are many reason behind the obesity in child as Physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, with genetics and lifestyle both playing important roles in determining a Child&#8217;s weight.

There are many factor of disease in child as heart disease, high cholesterol or high blood pressure, back bone and joint problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems such as stigmatization and poor self-esteem. Overweight young people are more likely than children of normal weight to become overweight or obese adults, and therefore more at risk for associated adult health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.

The term childhood obesity may refer to both children and adolescents. In general, we use the word, children to refer to 6 to 11 years of age, and adolescents to 12 to 17 years of age. If otherwise, and when possible, we will use a specific age or age range.
  
Childhood obesity is usually caused by eating too much and exercising too little. So we have to create new family habits for healthy eating and increased physical activity. It can help a child lose weight and can also improve the health of other family members.
  
There are many other ways to create a healthy environment in your family:
  
· Remove sugar-sweetened drinks from the home.
  
· Give more whole-grain foods with meals and breakfast.
  
· Reduce the number of meals eaten out side at fast-food center and other restaurants.
  
· Sit together for lunch/dinner and have that meal at least 30 minutes.
  
· Remove TVs and computers from child&#8217;s bedroom.
  
· Include children in active chores, such as washing the car or walking the dog.

Children can play ball at the local park and take healthier foods in school, at the end of the day family should support is what really counts. You are an also role model for your kids. They definitely follow you. Children form habits from parents, and usually maintain them into adulthood. If your children see you reach for a banana instead of a brownie, they are likely to do the same. If they see you go for a walk or wash the car, they may join you definitely.

Parents, teachers, companies, health-care professionals, teens and kids all have a part to play in the movement—in schools, at home, in restaurants, doctor’s offices, and in the community. Childhood obesity has no one cause, and there is no one solution. That’s why the Alliance is taking bold, innovative steps to help our children live longer and improve the health of our nation.
