Today I have come across an article on the use of eye drops containing the steroids. While few doctors prescribe the drops containing the steroids to give instant relief to the patient, some advice against it. It is explained in they said article that the infection is suppressed temporarily until you use the drop with steroids.

There after once you stop the same, the vigor of the infection becomes more and you will find the problem aggravated. Instead of going in for such steroids they suggest that the eye drops with antibiotics can give proper relief.

It may not be out of place to mention that the various sports persons use the steroids for better physical appearance and stamina. These are the illegal use resorted by them. It is in the interest of the humanity that such usage to be avoided and the doctors who prescribe the same without the need must be penalized.
