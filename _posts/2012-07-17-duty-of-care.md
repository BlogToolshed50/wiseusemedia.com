Company car and van drivers are involved in over 1,000 fatal accidents on Britain’s roads each year and almost 100,000 are injured while driving on company business.

Driving at Work: Managing Work-Related Road Safety Guide
  
To address this, in September 2003, the Health and Safety Executive published a guide called ‘Driving at Work: Managing work-related road safety’ guide. The guide highlights the legal responsibilities of companies, large or small, to comply, so far as is reasonably practicable, with the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

The guide stresses the benefits of managing work-related road safety and suggests ways of managing safety and assessing road risks. The aim of the guide is to reduce the number of casualties involving company car and van drivers, either in company or private vehicles.

Consequently, companies need to look at driver competency and training; driver health; knowledge of basic vehicle checks; vehicle suitability, condition and maintenance; if a valid MOT certificate is required, and safety equipment. The provisions of the guide even extend to allowing proper route planning and adequate travel time allowance.

As highlighted, the HSE guide applies equally to the use of privately-owned cars and vans on business trips. Companies are liable if employees use an un-roadworthy vehicle on company business so if they allow employees to use their own vehicles on business they have a duty of care to ensure they are monitoring the maintenance history of the vehicle and that the vehicle insurance also covers business use.

Incredibly one recent survey showed that 88% of staff using their own vehicles on company business had never had checks carried out on insurance or service records and over a third had not even had their driving licenses checked!

Companies that fail to act on the guide run the risk, in the event of an accident, of facing significant fines. Company directors and senior management could also face large fines and even possible imprisonment.

Legal experts have warned that companies could face prosecution under corporate manslaughter laws if, for example, an ‘at work’ driver did not have insurance for business use and was found guilty of causing an accident. 

The Right Vehicle for the Job

Duty of care can even be exercised at the time a new vehicle order is placed. Companies should make sure the new vehicle ordered is the right one for the job. For example, a hatchback or estate with the luggage platform at the right height would be the most appropriate for a sales representative regularly lifting loads. A sales representative off sick with a bad back is not what the employee or the company wants.

Vehicle specification could also be a determining factor in duty of care. By spending more on sensible options, companies can clearly demonstrate their duty of care. Many manufacturers offer power steering, ABS and driver/passenger airbags as standard but if not companies should specify them. Basic safety equipment should be on any company’s checklist as being essential in meeting its duty of care responsibilities. And drivers need to know how to use the equipment.

Besides basic safety equipment, consideration should be given to front fog lights, heated front windscreens, steering column audio controls and wide-angle heated mirrors. For driver comfort, the checklist should include height-adjustable seating, a height adjustable steering wheel and, possibly, even air conditioning.

A few sensible optional extras could help avoid a potentially heavy fine for not providing a suitably equipped vehicle. Companies failing to meet their duty of care responsibilities to their drivers will feel the pain as fines impact their bottom line and their overall public image.
