Are we safeguarding the environment, keeping in mind the future generation? Anyone can easily give a big &#8216;NO&#8221; as the answer. If you look at the recent satellite pictures on the Ice melting at Arctic, it goes without saying that we are all least bothered about our own selves leave alone the future generation. Our greed towards materialistic life had completely shattered the nature and the time are not far-off that we will face the consequence of our misdeeds.

The unusual early springtime melting of the ice at North Siberia and Alaska is an indication that the melting is going very fast than predicted and estimated. It is a matter of worry that the melting is spreading to the entire Arctic which may result in unexpected disaster in the days to come.

You will be surprised to know that the average air temperature during January to August in this region is as much as 5.4 degree more than the average temperature recorded 50 years ago The University of Colorado has warned that the melting is accelerating year by year. If the trend is allowed to continue, the temperature level is bound to go up leading to the various macro climatic changes globally.
