1. Email each visitor a satisfaction questionnaire after they purchase. This will allow you to improve your order system, customer service, site, etc.

2. Give a percentage of your profits to a cause your customers would like. It could be a charity, school, environmental improvements, etc.

3. Take harsh criticism the right way and improve your online business. Don&#8217;t get down in the dumps, improve the situation so it doesn&#8217;t happen again.

4. Try bartering before you buy services, supplies and equipment for your business. You can use the extra money you save on advertising your business.

5. Give away a follow-up email course on an auto-responder. Include your ad with each lesson. People will buy quicker when they see your ad repeatedly.

6. Make sure your classified ads don&#8217;t sound like an ad. Don&#8217;t ask people to buy anything or they won&#8217;t click, give something away instead.

7. Give your free bonus products extra perceived value. Don&#8217;t use the phrase &#8220;free bonuses&#8221; use the phrase &#8220;you will also get&#8221;.

8. Keep your visitors on your web site longer. The longer they stay, the greater chance they will buy. Just hold a treasure hunt contest on your web site.

9. Make sure you&#8217;re always creating new products and services or improving old ones. Most products or services won&#8217;t stand the test of time online.

10. Split the cost of online advertising and marketing by sharing a web site with a similar, non-competing business. You would both put up half the cost.
