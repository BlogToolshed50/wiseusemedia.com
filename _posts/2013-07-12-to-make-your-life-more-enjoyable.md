Living a happy, resilient and optimistic life is wonderful, and is also good for your health. Being happy actually protects you from the stresses of life. Stress is linked to top causes of death such as heart disease, cancer and stroke.

One of the better things ever said is &#8211; &#8216;The only thing in life that will always remain the same is change&#8217;, and in our life we have the power to make the necessary changes if we want to. Even if we find ourselves in an unbearable situation we can always find solace in the knowledge that it too would change.

Being in a group of positive people will help you become a happier person. You should find a group of people who accept you for who you are and not your financial status or looks.

Happiness is actually found in everyone. Increasing it is a way to make life more wonderful and also healthier.

To be happy is relatively easy. It’s actually a matter of just deciding to be happy. Abraham Lincoln observed that most people for most of the time can choose how happy or stressed, how relaxed or troubled, how bright or dull their outlook to be. The choice is simple really: choose to be happy.

Here are 10 ways you can make your life more enjoyable:

1. Have a Grateful Attitude

Being grateful is a great attitude. We have so much to be thankful for. Thank the taxi driver for bringing you home safely, thank the cook for a amazing dinner and thank the guy who cleans your windows. Also thank the mailman for bringing the mail, thank the policeman for making your place safe and thank the universe for being alive.

2. Don’t Read the News

News is stressful. Get less of it. Some people just can&#8217;t start their day without their daily dose of news. Try and think about it, 99% of the news we hear or read is bad news. Starting the day with bad news does not seem to be a sensible thing to do.

3. Develop Your Own Philosophy

Everyone has their own philosophy, it’s just a matter of defining your philosophy. Finding out what you believe, the actual process, is a way that will enlighten you and make you happy at the same time.

4. Manage Your Time

Time is invaluable and too important to waste. Time management can be viewed as a list of rules that involves scheduling, setting goals, planning, creating lists of things to do and prioritizing. These are the core basics of time management that should be understood to develop an efficient personal time management skill. These basic skills can be fine tuned further to include the finer points of each skill that can give you that extra reserve to make the results you desire.

5. Laugh

Laugh and laugh heartily everyday. Heard a good joke? Tell your friends or family about it. As they also say -&#8217;Laughter is the best medicine&#8217;.

6. Be an Open Book

Express your feelings, affections, friendship and passion to people around you. They will most likely reciprocate your actions. Try not to keep pent up anger of frustrations, this is bad for your health. Instead find ways of expressing them in a way that will not cause more injury or hurt to anyone.

7. Have a Good Work Ethic

Working hard brings tremendous personal satisfaction. It gives a feeling of being competent in finishing our tasks. Accomplishments are necessary for all of us, they give us a sense of value. Work on things that you feel worthy of your time.

8. Always be Willing to Learn

Learning is a joyful exercise. Try and learn something new everyday. Learning also makes us expand and broaden our horizons. And could also give us more opportunities in the future.

9. Exercise

Run, jog, walk and do other things that your body was made for. Feel alive.

10. Avoid Obvious Negative Environments

Avoid exposure to negative elements like loud noises, toxins and hazardous places.

Try to apply these 10 rules to your life and see how happy you turn out. Remember, as Lincoln once said: &#8220;Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.&#8221;
