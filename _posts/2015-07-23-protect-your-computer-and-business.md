We all take the computer for granted. I mean, all we have to do is switch it on and it&#8217;s ready to go. But did you ever stop to think what would happen if your computer suddenly crashed? And that is the only computer you have to work on!

What will happen to your work and your business for the next few days or weeks?

Do you have the original or a copy of all your programs?

Do you have the setup configurations, eg for your ISP?. You will need this to re-install some programs.

Do you have a copy of your email address book? Your email list or address book is vital to your business.

Do you remember all your passwords &#8211; for retrieving email, connecting to your ISP, membership sites, etc?

So what can you do to ensure that your computer will run as well as you&#8217;d expect, and continue working when your computer is down? Here&#8217;s a few simple tips:

1.Is your computer protected from viruses? Install an anti-virus software, and make sure to get regular updates. New viruses are coming out more often these days so you need to have updates regularly. Anything more than 3 months old needs to be updated today.

2.Install a firewall. Anytime your computer is connected to the Internet without a firewall, it is operating under an &#8220;open door&#8221; policy to intruders. Hackers can get in, take what they want, and even leave open a &#8220;back door&#8221; so they can turn your computer into a &#8220;zombie&#8221; and use it to attack other computers, distribute porn and spam.

Your bank account and credit card information, passwords, documents and personal files can be stolen while you&#8217;re busy surfing. Don&#8217;t let that happen!
