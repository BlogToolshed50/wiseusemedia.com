Positive talk with your child and generally within the household cannot be over-emphasized. Avoid criticism wherever possible; it is praise that produces good, successful behavior. Be sure to find at least one thing to praise in your child every day. Even better, give praise as often as possible.

Are you having problems finding good behaviors to praise? If so, give your child a task to do that you know he is capable of. Children love earning their parents&#8217; approval. Also remember to praise your child for trying, on those occasions that he is not successful.

Set a good example; talk about your goals and successes, and teach your child by example to accept compliments gracefully. Resist the temptation to put yourself down when you are complimented &#8211; instead, say a simple Thank You. That&#8217;s an important sign of a healthy self-esteem.

The other side of the coin to talking is, of course, listening. It is very important to listen to your child. When there is something he is upset about, don&#8217;t sweep it under the carpet by saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly!&#8221; Whatever it is might seem totally trivial to you but often all your child needs is for you to empathize. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you feel sad about that.&#8221; He may then come up with a solution, or put the incident behind him without further help. Or, you can suggest a solution
