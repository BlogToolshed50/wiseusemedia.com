What is going to trigger the gold price in future seems to be the inclination of various investors towards this precious metal. Be it an individual or a country, the focus is to bet the money on the safe heaven, the &#8220;gold&#8221; as the various leading currencies and other assets are found to lose their value. The return from gold is seen steadily increasing and the various nations are not interested to keep their reserve in USD as the currency is yet to come out of the woods. The recent Quantitative Ease proposed to the extent of USD600 billions by the Federal Reserve is bound to hit the market and the liquidity are sure to drive the gold price.

If you observe the recent trend in investing in gold by the various nations, it confirms their desire to divert their reserve into a portion of gold instead of a basket of various currencies. Recently countries like China, India and Srilanka had bought physical gold from the IMF to increase their proportion of gold in the reserve to ensure the safety. The fact that the gold mines are yielding less since 2007 is also a factor that can add more shine in terms of price to this most sought after metal value. Experts predict that the price of gold is likely to touch $2000 per ounce shortly.
