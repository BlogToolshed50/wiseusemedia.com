Do personality frameworks, transfer across cultures? The personality factors identified appear in almost all cross-cultural studies. There are no common personality types for a given country. You can, for instance, find high and low risk takers in almost any culture. Yet a country culture influences the dominant personality characteristics of its population.

Achieving Personality Fit
  
Twenty years ago, organizations were concerned with personality primarily because they wanted to match individuals to specific jobs. That concern still exists. But, in recent years, interest has expanded to include the individual- organization fit. Why? Because managers today are less interested in applicant’s ability to perform a specific job than with his or her flexibility to meet changing situations.

The Person-Job Fit
  
In the discussion of personality attributes, our conclusion were often qualified or recognize that the requirements of job moderated the relationship between possession of the personality characteristic and job performance.

The Person Organization Fit
  
As previously noted, attention in recent years has expanded to include matching people to organizations as well as jobs. To the degree that an organization faces a dynamic and changing environment and requires employees who are able to readily change tasks and move fluidly between teams, it’s probably more important that employees, personalities fit with overall organization’s culture than with the characteristics of any specific jobs.

The person-organization fit essentially argues that people leave jobs that are not compatible with their personality. Using the big five terminology, for instance, we could expect that people high in extroversion fit better with aggressive and team-oriented cultures; people high on agreeableness will match up with supportive organizational climate than one that focuses on aggressiveness; and that people high on openness to experience fit into organizations that emphasize innovation rather than standardization.
