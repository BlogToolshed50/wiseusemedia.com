Have you ever thought about someone out of the blue…and then they called you. Have you ever made a decision that everyone else thought was crazy, but you knew was right for you, and it worked out perfectly? Have you ever followed your gut instinct on something, and was proved gloriously RIGHT! If any of these have happened to you, you have experienced the power of intuition. Most of us at some stage wish we could have an inner guide that would tell us the right thing to do. The good news is that we do have an inner guide, the bad news is that the message can be fuzzy!

Benefits of Being Guided by Intuition

So what are the benefits of following your intuition as opposed to listening to the promptings of parents, partners and others? First of all, this begins to give you confidence in your own judgment. It helps you judge whether this person or opportunity is the right one for you…even if it may not seem so on paper. Secondly I have never met anyone who regretted following their intuition. Yes it may have meant making a difficult decision but it WAS the right ultimate decision for them. Many great business deals have been gone through on a hunch…or intuition.
