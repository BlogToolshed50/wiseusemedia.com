The one thing in life we can all count on is change. Many people have an aversion to, sometimes even a fear of change. Thankfully, I’ve learned some ground rules that have helped me co-create and readily accept change.
  
If change is a given, why then do people resist it so much? I think the answer lies in control. Maybe people have difficulty with change because they perceive it to be a loss of control. Change, however, is not bad! It is a very necessary thing. It is a source of rejuvenation. It provides zest in life. It challenges what it touches, forcing adaptation and improvement. It realigns you with your values.
  
How then do we more comfortably co-create and accept change, or at least incorporate it into our life with Ease? Ellie Drake, inspirational speaker and author, beautifully identifies six essences of change. These are:

1. Recognition
  
2. Reflection
  
3. Release
  
4. Replacement
  
5. Reprogramming and
  
6. Re-Integration

Let’s delve into these essences a little more. First, recognition is just what it is: One recognizes that a change is necessary. This may manifest itself as discomfort…either physical or emotional. You may notice tension throughout your body or your sleeping habits may change. Your appetite may go into overdrive or you may notice feelings of impatience, frustration or discontent. This is the universe letting you know something must change!

Now the question is “What must change?” This is where reflection comes in. What is the source of the discomfort? Notice how you feel, both physically and emotionally. Connect with your source and identify (or remind yourself of) your purpose. What in your world is not in agreement with your values? What is contradicting or inhibiting your growth and pursuit of your purpose? This leads us into our third essence of change.

Release. Release what you have identified as an inhibitor. Let go of that which is holding you back. With this release you will notice a load lifted, a sense of spaciousness within.

This sense of spaciousness may in fact begin to feel like an empty hole if the essence of replacement is overlooked. Replace the negative which wasn’t serving you with a positive that is aligned and supportive of your core values. Make this a conscious choice, a positive and pro active replacement.

Now that the detrimental aspect has been replaced with something positive, reprogramming is a necessary step. Learn how to incorporate this new dynamic into your life. You will experience more ease, will find and stay in the flow more easily and will experience joy.

Over time and with application you will see that reprogramming your thoughts, feelings and actions will bring you to a place of reintegration. The positive change you have made will be seamlessly incorporated into other aspects of your life.

Change is a necessity of and shouldn&#8217;t be perceived as bad. Applying the essences of recognition, reflection, release, replacement, reprogramming and re-integration when encountering a need for change actually makes it easier to manage. With practice, it goes much beyond “managing” and is in fact co-creating. Instead of being reactive to change you become pro active with change. You don’t then lose control in the face of change, but rather co-create change for yourself that positively impacts your life and assists you in passionately pursuing your purpose.
