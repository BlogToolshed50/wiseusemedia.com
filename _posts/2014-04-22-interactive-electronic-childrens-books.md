Did you know there are numerous authors that have published children&#8217;s books in electronic format? What is electronic format? Well, that is when a book is available from the computer as a download or on CD or on diskette.

If a customer purchases a book as a download, then the publisher sends them the book through email sometimes with a link where they can go to download it themselves, or as an attachment. If the customer purchases the book on CD or diskette, then the book will arrive through the mail with cover art, spine, author information, ISBN (International Standard Book Number, which is a ten-digit number that uniquely identifies books and book-like products that are published internationally. It identifies one title or an edition of a title from one specific publisher), and instructions on how to open your book.
