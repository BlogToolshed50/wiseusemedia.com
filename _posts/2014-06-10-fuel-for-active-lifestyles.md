The hot summer months represent a time for getting fit, having fun and engaging in lots of outdoor physical activity. The following tips will help you gain the essential fuel needed for an active lifestyle:

* Drink lots of water. Always be sure to have a bottle of water on hand in the event that you become dehydrated in the warm weather.

* Eat a nutritious diet according to Canada&#8217;s Food Guide, packed with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables like peaches, strawberries or corn on the cob. The summer months are an ideal time to take advantage of the fresh local produce. Try to avoid the empty calories and high fat content of fast foods when you&#8217;re on the run.

* Protect your skin with a sunblock suitable for your skin. A sunburn can cause you to feel ill and light headed, not to mention it increases your risk of skin cancer. Protect your face and eyes by wearing a baseball cap and UV protective sunglasses.

* Take a daily multivitamin year round that is formulated specifically for people with a physically active lifestyle.

* Have fun and play safe!
