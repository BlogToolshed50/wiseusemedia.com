What is life? What does it mean to be a success? What is winning?

Why all the questions?

Because it's important for you to know the answers. - Not somebody else's answers. Not the Philosophy 101 textbook answers. And, of course, looking up the definitions in Webster's doesn't count. The important answers to these questions, the best ones, are your answers, your definitions. 

When you have your answers to these questions you also have a framework, a foundation, for your life and what you do with it. Answering these questions helps you create a benchmark for determining whether or not you are being true to your self and really doing the things that bring you joy. If you don't decide that "Success = XX" then how do you know if you're successful? If don't decide that "Life is XXXX", how do you know if you're really living? 

If you've already got the answers, consider them closely. Are they really, truly, 100% yours? If yes, great! If you weren't the one to create the definition success that you use, who did? Likewise, if you haven't yet defined it, then whose definition of life are you following? If it wasn't you, chances are you're attempting to fulfill somebody else's idea of what success should be. For most people, that's a direct route to misery. 

After allArticle Submission, whose life is it anyway? 

If your answer is "It's my life!" then start defining your life today! Create your personal definition of success. Determine on your own when and how you'll truly be successful and what your life will look like each and every day. You'll soon discover that the more you define your life the more you'll live the fine life that you truly desire
