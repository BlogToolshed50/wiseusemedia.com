1. Make sure your goals are SMART goals. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time bound. This gives them power and clarity.

2. Take your 5 year goals, and split then into year by year goals. Then take your first year goal and split further into 6 months goals. Then work on the month by month increments. Work on how you will start updating your resume, or start saving $200 dollars each month, or find a book or video on Yoga or aerobic exercises.

You can even start jogging for 15-20 minutes a day, and then gradually increase it to about 30 to 45 minutes, and eventually take it to an hour of exercises. 6 months is not a very long period. You could have lost a few pounds by then, become a lot trimmer, and will have a new wardrobe of nicely fitting clothes that will give your personality an extra edge.

3. Use a Daily Checklist to remind yourself of the actions you need to take each day to achieving your goals. Don&#8217;t skip a single day. Even if you can spare only 30 minutes towards your goals, doing so consistently will soon add up, and you will begin to notice the difference it is making in your life!

4. Do a periodic Review of your long and short term goals. See what is working, and feel free to make amends to reflect what you want to change, and what you have already achieved. Keep in mind that personal goal setting is an ever evolving exercise. Your goals evolve dynamically based on the changes in nature, your self and your environment. So keep reviewing them regularly to stay on course.

What are you waiting for? Go ahead, get started now. Write down your goals now. When you look back in a few months time, you will cherish this moment of decision. It will take you towards getting that house, the car, be mortgage free, or find the loving relationship you are looking for.
