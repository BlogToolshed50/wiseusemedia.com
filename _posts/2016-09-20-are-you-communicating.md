Many Native American tribes use a unique way of communicating. No, I'm not talking about sending smoke signals. I'm referring to the use of a Talking Stick. Only the person holding the Talking Stick is allowed to speak. This is very useful at a tribal "board" meeting because arguing is kept to a minimum then, and each person has one job to do - Listen - unless s/he has the Talking Stick. 

On really big decisions the Talking Stick is passed, one to the next, all around the circle as each person gets to have a say in the discussion without others interrupting or starting an argument. Ah, I wish I had known about this Talking Stick when my children were growing up. 

Here's a simple solution for other families today - Listen, Pause, Clarify and Validate. Read on, I think it will make great good sense to you, too.
