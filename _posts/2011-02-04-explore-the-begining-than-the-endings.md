I have recently come across a leaflet containing the motivational aspect about the beginning of everything in our life. The famous poet Robert Browning once wrote&#8221; Two roads diverged in the woods and I took the one less traveled by others. And it made the difference&#8221; Many a time we may have also taken such significant and vital decision in our life which might have completely changed the course of our life. Some might have worked and succeeded while few must have failed. Ultimately, when you weigh the pros and cons along with the outcome, all these vital experiences must have definitely made us better person in every perspective. Success and failure are only protagonists in our mind. Real success depends on how we play with these characters.

A train journey is often an enjoyable experience. As the train snakes its way forward, we can see nature in its myriad form flashing past us. But the train reaches the destination irrespective of the intervening scenario on the path. Life is like that. It is not going to stop for us. Success and failures are ephemeral and we need to continue our journey like a silent spectator unmoved by the course of events we stumble upon. For direction we always look back and for inspiration we look ahead. The future is always bright provided we explore more &#8220;beginning than endings&#8221;. Every endings lead to a new beginning with the exposure and experience in our life.
