Attachment parenting is a style of caring for your infant that brings out the best in the baby and the best in the parents.

Attachment parenting almost begs off having a name by its very definition. Also known as “instinctive parenting,” “intuitive parenting” and “natural parenting,” Attachment Parenting is fundamentally a relationship rather than a strategy, an act rather than a style.

The mission of Attachment Parenting is to promote parenting practices that create strong, healthy emotional bonds between children and their parents. I believe these practices nurture and fulfill a child&#8217;s need for trust, empathy, and affection, providing a lifelong foundation for healthy, enduring relationships.

Through education, support, advocacy and research, attachment parenting seeks to strengthen families and increase awareness of the importance of secure attachment, ultimately helping to reduce or prevent child abuse, behavioral disorders, criminal acts and other serious social problems.

Sensitive, responsive physical and emotional bonds between parents and their babies lie at the heart of attachment parenting. Seven basic “B’s” for parent/child pairs just getting started:

• Birth bonding
  
• Breastfeeding
  
• Baby wearing
  
• Bedding close to baby
  
• Believing in the language value of your baby’s cry
  
• Beware of baby trainers
  
• Balance

Attachment parenting implies first opening your mind and heart to the individual needs of your baby, and eventually you will develop the wisdom on how to make on-the-spot decisions on what works best for both you and your baby. Do the best you can with the resources you have – that&#8217;s all your child will ever expect of you.

The benefit of attachment parenting is intuitive parenting styles. Information on the Family Bed (co-sleeping), gentle discipline (positive, non-punitive and guidance oriented), &#8220;wearing&#8221; your baby and more.

So after all attachment parenting, a phrase coined by pediatrician William Sears, is a parenting philosophy based on the principles of the attachment theory in developmental psychology. According to attachment theory, a strong emotional bond with parents during childhood, also known as a secure attachment, is a precursor of secure, empathic relationships in adulthood.
