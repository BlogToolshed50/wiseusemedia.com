The latest declaration on the level of hunger in the globe is some what encouraging. UN food agency has informed the reduction in the hunger level to the extent of 10 % for this year. This is claimed to be the first ever drop in the figure since 1995.

As such an extent of 925mn people are found to be under nourished in the world against the figure of about 102mn last year. Despite this encouraging data, we must be more concerned to note that ONE child dies every SIX SECONDS due to under nourishment.

The major worry looming large on the globe is the recent natural calamities like flood in Pakistan, fire in Russia and rain in China, which is bound to affect the food production this year. It is certain that the food production will go down and the population with hunger will look up. We must learn the lesion from every calamity and save the environment to attack poverty and malnutrition.
