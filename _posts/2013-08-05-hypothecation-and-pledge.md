In the financial sector, we come across many types creating charge over the property financed by the banks and various financial institutions. The major and most commonly used charge is by way of &#8220;Hypothecation of the assets created out the fund given to the borrower. Hypothecation is an equitable charge where the borrower keeps the possession of the property or security on behalf of the creditor while the charge remains over the asset. In case of failure on the part of the borrower to repay the loan taken, the financial institution can exercise the right of Hypothecation over the asset and seize the same to sell it off to realize the dues.

Through the process of the Hypothecation, the bank or the financial institution can take poss-session of the asset with the consent of the borrower and, then it becomes a pledge. Once the bank of the financial institution becomes the pledge, it can sell the asset even without the consent of the party or the borrower. In such circumstance, even the permission from the court of law is also not needed to sell the asset under pledge. However, the pledge has to follow certain legal formalities while selling the asset to maintain the transparency.
