We all know what &#8220;posture&#8221; means.. standing erect, etc. But with regard to your business, your posture &#8211; your level of confidence and competence &#8211; determines how you are perceived by others. Developing posture takes training, dedication and time. Believe in yourself and your business, and until you do believe in yourself and your business, pretend you do! Practice confidence consciously and you will find that people are drawn to you and eager to learn from you.

When I first started my home-based business many years ago, I didn&#8217;t understand why no one took me seriously. I learned that it was because I had not yet developed my posture. I didn&#8217;t believe in myself so how could I expect anyone else to believe in me? Then one day I realized people were responding much more positively to me and my business began to grow! I mentioned it to one of my company leaders and she said &#8220;It&#8217;s your posture.&#8221; It was a great day for me!

Two of my favorite ways of developing my posture are as follows:

1. 60 Second Commercial

Determine your weaknesses and the areas of your life that you would like to improve. Then write your &#8220;60 Second Commercial,&#8221; a statement of how you desire to be once you have overcome your weaknesses. Write it as if you have already accomplished your posture. For example, because many people have a fear of phone calls and doing follow up calls, you might include something similar to the following:

&#8220;I love making my follow up calls! I am really great talking to people about the products and the business. People trust me and respect my views and opinions. When I call people on the telephone, they are always glad to hear from me and anxious to hear what I have to say. I have tremendous confidence in myself and my ability to help others achieve success.&#8221;

I taped my 60 Second Commercial to my bathroom mirror and read it to myself every morning and every night. It&#8217;s a powerful thing when you begin to believe what you are reading. and then it becomes reality.

2. Vision

I have learned that having a Vision, a description of the first day that you accomplish your goals. For example, if your goal is to quit your J.O.B. and go full time with your network marketing company, you might write your Vision to describe the first day you wake up and begin your adventure as a full time network marketer. Be sure to include sights, sounds smells, etc. Make it feel real. Then read your Vision to yourself every day &#8211; even twice a day &#8211; until your vision becomes as real to you as your present. When your subconscious hears your Vision daily, it begins to believe it (I&#8217;ve heard that the subconscious mind cannot take a joke!) and therefore gets busy helping you to accomplish the goals and dreams contained in that Vision. This is very powerful.

You will know when you have developed your posture because people will be ATTRACTED to you. It will impact every part of your life &#8211; personal and professional. I wish you every success on your journey to greater posture!
