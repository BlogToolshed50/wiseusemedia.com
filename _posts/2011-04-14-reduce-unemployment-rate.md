Unemployment is the main reason for most of the social problems that are prevalent. Employment generation in various countries is not in commensurate with the exploding population and that too with the increasing numbers of youths. Unlike in the past, the present day youngsters loath hard physical work. In order to provide them white color jobs, it has become very difficult for any Nation.
