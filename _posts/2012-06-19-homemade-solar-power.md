Solar Power for homes can be harnessed by building your own solar panels and converting that energy into electricity to power home appliances. Sunlight is the greatest gift for mother earth and the beauty of it is, it is totally free. Paradoxically, you seem not to be able to tap on the abundance of sun power by the looks of your monthly escalating electricity bills.

I used to stare up at the sky often enough too, wondering how I could tap the abundance of solar power for my own use. Had I not had this dream, I would not have built my own solar panels, and successfully too.

I decided to build my own solar panels instead of buying ready made ones after I did my research. The ready made ones could set you back about 3000 dollars per panel but if I build my own, I spend less than 200 dollars for a full panel. And by experience, I can say that you could actually save around 60 to 80 percent of your utility bills if you follow exactly the instructions on the manual. That is a cost savings of about 200 to 400 dollars depending on your usual level of energy consumption. Not to forget too that this is consistent monthly savings throughout the lifespan of the solar panels.

As my research showed that building your own solar panels do not require specific technical expertise, I braved all odds to try out this special pet project. It is very important to get a good manual or guide book, a few of which are available on the internet. The guide books must have easy to follow instructions and pre-designed diagrams ready for your assembly. Look out for the better ones which provide step by step videos to speed you up on the project, give free access to member forums and free lifetime updates too. And you would think that this is going to be expensive. Think again, as this manual usually cost less than a good meal.

I could not believe the fact that all the materials I need are available under one roof, right at my neighborhood hardware store.

My solar panels were up and running over one weekend of hard work and I have many months and years to be thankful for whenever I see my much reduced utility bills.

I am liberated. Are you yet?
