As an artist, normally we think that our future will solely depend upon commercial galleries. Though, such practices have become inexact as well as self limiting. Well! Reasons are so obvious that such galleries can not be accessible by everyone. On the hand, we have mentioned the term &#8216;self limiting&#8217; because such galleries can not be residence of all those artists who want to exhibit their art works. So, we have seen a new trend &#8216;art online&#8217;.

In experts&#8217; opinion, heterogeneity of artwork and infrequency of trading are two biggest hurdle of art commerce. But World Wide Web has realized this concern and offered few fabulous online platforms where one can experience a whole new world of art commerce. There is one more aspect of art commerce which draws a delicate line between bourgeois world of arts and popular world of electronic media (TV, Radio, etc.). World Wide Web has almost eliminated this line. Probably, this is the greatest achievement of cyber space. An Article by &#8216;James E. Pesando&#8217; states-

&#8216;In a well-functioning capital market, the risk-adjusted rates of return on all assets will be forced to equality. The equilibrium return on art, net of insurance and storage costs and any flow of consumption services, will equal the equilibrium return on competing assets with identical risk. If this is not the case, then art is an investment which compares &#8216;favorably or unfavorably&#8217; with traditional financial assets.&#8217;

Probably, these are amongst the most precise words which explores aesthetic limitation of art.
