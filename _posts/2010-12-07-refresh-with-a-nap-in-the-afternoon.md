It is an interesting news that I have come across in one of the news items recently. The afternoon &#8220;nap&#8221; said to help the person to refresh himself to be alert in the evening session of the office. It is advisable that the nap should be time specific and duration specific every day. Irregular nap may lead to sleep loss as confirmed by the researchers.

It is reported that a nap over a period of 30 to 60 minutes every day in the afternoon improves the turn out and efficiency of the person to work in the afternoon period. If the nap is not done at the same time every day it may lead to insomnia as revealed in various studies.

One should keep in mind that the nap should not disturb his regular sleeping habit. They call it as the &#8220;siesta&#8221; and the nap is normally taken in the afternoon after the meals. It has become a common habit in many countries like China, Philipines, Italy, Malta and India. Since it helps the person to refresh, it is found to be beneficial.
