Confidence can be hard to pin down at times! Most people have had the experience of observing someone they know at a party or in a work situation, communicating with ease and naturally, without a hint of self-consciousness and have thought, “Why cant that be me?”

People look to hypnotherapy, Hertz for all types of confidence problems. It may be that you lack confidence within specific relationships or situations, you may want to be more assertive or to become a better public speaker. Perhaps you want to be able to share some of the knowledge and ideas that you hold back because of lack of confidence, or you find it difficult to speak up in front of groups of people. Some people feel they lack confidence in all areas of their lives. All these experiences are common and can be helped by hypnotherapy.

Of course, in life there will always be natural differences among people. Some people just seem to be more introverted, whilst others seem to enjoy the limelight and draw others towards them with ease. Whether confidence is a problem is self-defined by the individual. If it impacts on your life in subtle or more obvious ways and you feel frustrated or held back by lack of confidence, then hypnotherapy may benefit you.

Hypnotherapists use hypnosis to bring about positive therapeutic changes in order to help people solve problems, such as lack of confidence. Hypnosis is an experience characterized by deep relaxation, a concentrated focus and increased sensory alertness. This state of mind occurs spontaneously and people slip in and out of this state, known as ‘trance’, all the time, in everyday life. Examples of trance states include fantasizing about someone you are attracted to, becoming deeply immersed in a book, being anxious about an event causing you to re-live what could go wrong over and over in your head and daydreaming. As you may see from the examples given, trance states can be positive or negative, depending on what is being focused on.

Hypnotherapists induce deeply relaxing trance states because when a person is deeply relaxed, access to the unconscious mind is enabled. The hypnotic process is wonderfully pleasant and relaxing, which in itself is beneficial for people who lack confidence and experience stress and worry on a regular basis. Being free of stress and worry, during the hypnotic process, allows the therapists to pack your unconscious mind with positive suggestions of confidence. Whilst in this state you also get to practice situations in which you will act with confidence and conviction, through a process known as visualization.

Hypnotherapy can also be effective in removing negative associations that you have developed between situations and feeling unconfined and it can also be used to remove and free you from negative emotions from the past. Sometimes self-esteem can be related to childhood experiences and these can be dealt with through at Hypnotherapy.

During your hypnotherapy treatment, the hypnotherapist will also work with you to achieve confidence through a technique called anchoring, which involves learning to develop an association between an external trigger, and a emotional response. Anchors develop all the time in everyday life as the human mind attempts to understand your environment by looking for patterns between things. Not all anchors are positive. People learn to make negative associations between things, such as feeling anxious or worried when they are required to give a presentation to colleagues. Your hypnotherapist can work with you to remove negative anchors.
