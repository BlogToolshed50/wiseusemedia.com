When I read the recent flood and the fire along with the major landslide in the various places worldwide, the future of the humans is not looking so rosy. The exploitation of the nature for the selfish motive of the individuals, unmindful of the society has led us to these disasters. Still the awakening is not there where it is to be there. Forest conservation is going out of our mind and we are worried about the luxury we enjoy by killing the forest cover.

It is paining to note that the world&#8217;s greatest natural resource at Amazon Rain forest is under continuous destruction. The economic and the environmental implication is unimaginable. A simple economics shows that an acre of the rain forest converted to cattle operation gives $60 while the same one acre is worth $400 if the timber there in is allowed to grow.

If proper market is created for the sustainable and renewable rain forest resources, the rain forests can be saved and the ecological balance can be maintained along with the economic benefits. Unless the true wealth of the forest is understood by the human folks through proper education.
