In the present world all are talking about the work pressure, tension etc which all can be avoided if we are able to understand the root cause.

If we analyze all the cases in detail that are causing this so called &#8220;tension&#8221;, &#8220;pressure&#8221; etc, we alone are the culprit. But then we are taken away by the materialistic point of view & simply putting the blame on others.

Our human body is the most complex where in no one is able to understand how all the functions are synchronized with in no time. We all are gifted with decision making capabilities, but then still when it comes to critical situations at which a decision has to be taken; we try to play a safe game so to avoid criticism. The saddest part is not escaping from the game, but commenting on the action behind the scene.

We are all hung up in the head. This is the main problem & the one & only solution for that is get down from the head into the heart & all problems disappear. All the problems are created by the head. Mysteries remain but problem will disappear.

All the experiences that happen in life are like the small clouds; they come & go& are not worth paying much attention to. One should always remember that they are the sky, the clear blue infinite sky & then no clouds can distort you. Take no notice of such small clouds & they will never come uninvited.

We should be able to live our life in such a way that nobody is harmed neither by our actions nor by our words. We should live in a creative way, with skill & art. Live in a sensitive way & never become attached.

Root causes of all depressions are expectation & anxiety. The only solution is to remain detached.
