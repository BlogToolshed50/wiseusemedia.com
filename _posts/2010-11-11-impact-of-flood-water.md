Our fight against nature for a luxury and the so-called comfortable life is leading to great disasters like flood, drought and fire. The recent floods at Pakistan, China and India are the testimony for the reaction of the nature to the irresponsibility of the humanity. If you look into the impact of the 1997 Red River valley flood in the Monitoba region, we should learn the lesson to deal with the nature.

The Microbiological contamination of the water in the wells in around was so bad that the water became unfit for the human consumption. As a result of the flood the upper carbonate aquifer was contaminated to a great extent. The conform bacteria level after flood was found at the range of Zero to 2000 organisms per 100 ml. One can imagine the severity of the impact.

Individual well water became more turbid like the flood water in the plain and in the river. The debris accumulated as the result of the flood water too remained a cause for concern as the carcasses of the dead animals and the human added to the contamination. The resultant outburst of diseases is yet another nightmare for the people of the flood affected area.
